Backlog:

* Write tests for 100% coverage
* Add more statistics
* Add tests for anything where scrub marks blocks as invalid (source changed,
  bitrod in backup, ...
* Make restore multi-threaded
* Make restore accept rbd volumes as target

Next:

* Change lock lib to be a wrapper, possibly with a context manager
* Add shell scripting to exports so that a shell script can restore any backup
