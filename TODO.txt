* Possibly detect chunks full of \0 and give them special treatment in the index
  and don't write them to the disk. On restore, they should be rewritten as \0
  and deep_scrub should check the source against \0s.
* Maybe add info to version what the orig filename was and warn if new one diffs
* Write tests for 100% coverage
* Remove dependency on sql
* Add tests for anything where scrub marks blocks as invalid (source changed,
  bitrod in backup, ...
* Make configurable if dedup should be done live
* Add a dedup command for later dedups
* Make writer thread to write while reading
* Check if sha512 is a performance bottleneck
* Check if it's faster to search for block's checksums in bulk than one on one.
  Maybe live-dedup becomes faster that way
* Add more statistics
