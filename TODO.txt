Backlog:

* Write tests for 100% coverage
* Add more statistics
* Add tests for anything where scrub marks blocks as invalid (source changed,
  bitrod in backup, ...
* Make restore multi-threaded
* Make restore accept rbd volumes as target
* Consider using click (http://click.pocoo.org/6/) for option parsing
* Check if we really should do image.close() ioctx.close() cluster.shutdown() as
  recommended in http://docs.ceph.com/docs/jewel/rbd/librbdpy/

Next:

* Parallelize reads during restore (backy.py:257 data = self.data_backend.read(block.uid))
  as this is a bottleneck, especially with s3 storage
* Change lock lib to be a wrapper, possibly with a context manager
* Add shell scripting to exports so that a shell script can restore any backup
