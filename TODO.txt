* Possibly detect chunks full of \0 and give them special treatment in the index
  and don't write them to the disk. On restore, they should be rewritten as \0
  and deep_scrub should check the source against \0s.
* Maybe add info to version what the orig filename was and warn if new one diffs
* Write tests for 100% coverage
* Remove dependency on sql
