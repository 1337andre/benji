* When rbd diff says exists:'false', eventually release the chunk from base
* Make sure that mtime is kept when scrub finds defect blocks
* In case of restore: Maybe write unknown chunks as \0? This works for spares
  writes on image files automatically, but not on device files. Maybe give this
  as an option...
* Possibly detect chunks full of \0 and give them special treatment in the index
  and don't write them to the disk. On restore, they should be rewritten as \0
  and deep_scrub should check the source against \0s.
* Add capability of rewriting a base file, because over time there could be
  a significant number of not-anymore-existing blocks. Rewriting would leave them
  out of the data file
