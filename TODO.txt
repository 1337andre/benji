* When rbd diff says exists:'false', eventually release the chunk from base
* Make sure that mtime is kept when scrub finds defect blocks
* In case of restore: Maybe write unknown chunks as \0? This works for spares
  writes on image files automatically, but not on device files. Maybe give this
  as an option...
* When backup, ceph exists='false' chunks are expected to be full of \0 on scrub.
  Maybe write them as \0 or mark them in the index?
